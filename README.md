I have made a simple voting system without any security measures.I made this project keeping in mind the democratic system of my country Pakistan.
--> I used JAVA as my backend language.
--> I used JAVA SWING library for GUI.
--> I used MYSQL server for database to store voters, parties, candidates etc.


STEPS INVOLVED:
1) Create database Voting-System in MySQL workbench.The sql code is provided. Then add data to the database (sample data is also given).
2) you need to download JDBC driver for java database connectivity with MySQL server. Also link the jarr file to your voting system project in your ide in the referenced libraries section (I used eclipse ide to make this project).
3)All the java code is given, first you need to run the file addPartyImages.java to add party symbols to the database. Then you can start the voting system by running the class authenticateGUI.java .
